\subsubsection*{}

\begin{definition}
		A \textit{vector space}\index{Vector Space} \(V\) over a field \(F\) consists of a set on which two operations are defined so that for each \(x,y\in V\) there exists \(x+y\in V\) and \(ax\in V\;\forall a\in F\) such that the following hold:

\[
\forall x, y \in V, \; x + y = y + x
\]

\[
\forall x, y, z \in V, \; (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)
\]

\[
\exists 0 \in V | x + 0 = x, \; \forall x \in V
\]

\[
\forall x \in V, \; \exists y \in V | x + y = 0
\]

\[
\forall x \in V, \; 1x = x
\]

\[
\forall a, b \in F, x \in V, \; (ab)x = a(bx)
\]

\[
\forall a \in F \text{and} x, y \in V, \; a(x + y) = ax + ay
\]

\[
\forall a,b\in F,x\in V,\; (a+b)x = ax+bx
\]

\end{definition}


\begin{example}
		The set of \(n\)-tuples from a field \(F\) is denoted \(F^n\). This set is a vector space over \(F\) with the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. That is, if \(u = (a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n}), v = (b_{1},b_{2},\dots,b_{n})\) and \(c\in F\)\\
then \(u + v = (a_{1}+b_{1},a_{2}+b_{2},\dots,a_{n}+b_{n})\) and \(cu = (ca_{1},ca_{2},\dots,ca_{n})\).

\end{example}


\begin{example}
		The set of \(m\times n\) matrices with entries from a field \(F\) is a vector space, denoted \(M_{m\times n}(F)\), with the operations of matrix addition and scalar multiplication. Let \(A,B\in M_{m\times n}(F)\) and let \(c\in F\). Then

\[
(A + B)_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}, c(A_{ij}) = cA_{ij}
\]

\end{example}


\begin{example}
		Let

\[
f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} +\dots+ a_{1}x + a_{0} \text{and} g(x) = b_{n}x^{n} + b_{n-1}x^{n-1} +\dots+ b_{1}x + b_{0}
\]
		be polynomials with coefficients from a field \(F\). Define

\[
f(x)+g(x) = (a_{n}+b_{n})x^{n}+(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1})x^{n-1}+\dots+(a_{1}+b_{1})x+(a_{0}+b_{0})
\]

\[
\text{and}
\]

\[
cf(x) = ca_{n}x^{n}+ca_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+ca_{1}x+ca_{0}
\]
		 Under this construction, the set of polynomials with coefficients from a field \(F\) is a vector space and is denoted \(P(F)\)

\end{example}


\begin{example}
		Let \(S = \{(a_{1}, a_{2})|a_{1}, a_{2}\} \in \mathbb{R}\) and define the following two\\
 operations:

\[
(a_{1}, a_{2}) + (b_{1}, b_{2}) = (a_{1} + b_{1}, a_{2} - b_{2})
\]

\[
c(a_{1}, a_{2}) = (ca_{1}, ca_{2})
\]
		Notice that conditions 1,2 and 8 of a vector space fail to hold so S is not a vector space.

\end{example}


\begin{theorem}[Cancellation Law of Vector Addition]
		if \(x,y,z\in V\) and \(x+z = y+z\), then \(x = y\)

\begin{proof}
			By condition 4 of a vector space, there is a vector \(v\) such that \(z+v = 0\). Now,

\[
x = x + 0 = x + (z + v) = (x + z) + v = (y + z) + v = y + (z + v) = y + 0 = y
\]
			by conditions 2 and 3 of a vector space

\end{proof}

\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}[Zero Vector Properties]
		In any vector space \(V\), the following hold:

\[
\ forall x \in V, \; 0x = 0
\]

\[
\ forall a\in F, x \in V, \; (-a)x = -a(x) = a(-x)
\]

\[
\ forall a\in F, \; a0 = 0
\]

\end{theorem}

\subsubsection*{Problems}


\begin{problem}
		Let \(S = \{0,1\}\) and \(F = R\). Show that \(f = g\) and \(f+g = h\) where \(f(x) = st+1\), \(g(x) = 1 + 4t + 2t^{2}\), \(h(x) = 5^{t} + 1\).

\end{problem}


\begin{solution}
		Since the set \(S\) consists of only 0 and 1, the following is sufficient to show that \(f = g\) and \(f+g = h\):

\[
f(0) = 2(0) + 1 = 1 = 1 + 4(0) + 2(0)^{2} = g(0)
\]

\[
f(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3 = 1 + 4(1) + 2(1)^{2} = g(1)
\]

\[
f(0) + g(0) = 1 + 1 = 5^{0}+1 = h(0)
\]

\[
f(1) + g(1) = 3 + 3 = 6 = 5^{1}+1 = h(1)
\]

\end{solution}


\begin{problem}
		Show that

\[
(a + b)(x + y) = ax + ay + bx + by)
\]
		for any \(x, y \in V\) and \(a, b \in F\)

\end{problem}


\begin{solution}

\begin{proof}
			Let \(V\) be a vector space with \(x, y \in V\). Then by condition 7 and 8 of a vector space,

\[
(a + b)(x + y) = a(x + y) + b(x + y) = ax + ay + bx + by
\]

\end{proof}
\end{solution}
